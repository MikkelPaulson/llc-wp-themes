    #Conditional statements
    
    Often you'll want to show certain bits of content based on specific conditions. 
    
    For example, in the current [Sydney theme header](slides.html#heading-options), you could show the site title & tagline OR just the logo. The if statement's logic might look something like this:
    
    ```
    <?php
    if ( logo image has been added ) {
        show the logo
    } else {
        show the site title and tagline
    }
    ?>
    ```
  </script>
</section>

    #Conditional statements: Syntax
    
    ```php
    <?php
    if ( condition ) {
        // code to execute if condition is true
    } else {
        // code to execute if condition is false
    }
    ?>
    ```
    
    Alternative syntax:
    
    ```php
    <?php
    if (condition):
        //code to execute if condition is true
    else:
        //code to execute if condition is false
    endif;
    ?>
    ```
    
    You can mix HTML in between the conditional statement too but remember to open & close the PHP tags to exit out of "PHP mode."
    
    ```php
    <?php if (condition): ?>
        <img src="logo.png" alt="logo">
    <?php else: ?>
        <h1>Site Title</h1>
    <?php endif; ?>
    ```
    
    Note that `else` is not required.  Use it to provide an alternative option if the condition is not met.

        ##What is WordPress?
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/wp-logo.png)
        
        * one of many types of blogging software and CMS
        * used by many individuals and companies (ladieslearningcode.com is powered by WordPress!)
        * an online, open source (a.k.a. free) website creation tool 
        * written primarily in [PHP](http://www.php.net) and [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com)
        * uses PHP templates & a database to create and store content
        * used to create **dynamic** websites
        
        <br>
        It's important to note that the learning curve may feel steep in comparison to HTML & CSS. However, the amount and complexity of the code editing will depend on your needs and level of customization.

        ## What is a CMS?
        
        A content management system (CMS), is an application used to edit content and manage a website using a graphical user interface.
        
        Web content can be modified and published without editing the code or database.
        
        A CMS like WordPress also includes features such as:
        
        * database management 
        * themes and templates for page layouts
        * making content searchable and indexable
        * and much more!
        
        There are other CMS platforms as well, such as [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org).

        ## What is PHP?
        
        HTML, CSS & JavaScript are examples of *client-side* languages. They run in the *browser*.

        PHP is a *server-side* language and runs in the *web server*. PHP development began in the mid-90s and originally stood for Personal Home Page, but now stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. (Yep, that first “P” stands for PHP.)

        PHP requires a *server* to run the commands so you can't just simply open a PHP page in your browser like an HTML page.

        PHP code can be written on its own, mixed with HTML, or used in combination with many templating engines and frameworks like Wordpress.

        PHP can be used to make a website *dynamic*. PHP can generate HTML, and HTML can pass information to PHP so if you view source on the Ladies Learning Code site, you cannot see the PHP code, even though it's being used to run the WordPress code base.

        ##Blog vs Website
        
        How are blogs different from standard websites?
        
        * the term *blog* is an abbreviation for *weblog*
        * blogs often contain an ongoing collection of posts and articles presented in date-based order
        * blogs are often (but not always) written in a diary-style commentary or first-person narrative
        * a website can contain both blog section and standard informational web pages like an about or contact page
        
        WordPress started as primarily a blogging platform but has since been a choice for many as the platform to create entire websites on.

        [WordPress**.com**](http://wordpress.com)
        
        * hosted and all technical maintenance handled by WordPress
        * has fewer options for customizing
        * do not need to edit the code
        * some paid upgrades available for some customization
        * no plugins
        
        [WordPress**.org**](http://wordpress.org)
        
        * provides the codebase for free to download & edit
        * requires you to purchase our own domain and hosting
        * You are responsible for the site maintenance
        * you get full control over theme files & code
        * plugins are available

        ##Developing locally
        
        Developing your website *locally*, whether it's HTML or WordPress, means developing it on your computer.  It can only run and be seen on your computer (or whatever computer your files are on)!
        
        Remember, since WordPress runs on PHP, a PHP file cannot be opened in a web browser. It needs to run on a server.
        
        It's better to make changes to your code *locally* rather than on your live web server, so you get a chance to test it before the world sees it.

        ## Setting up your dev environment
        
        What will you need?
        
        1. A text editor to write & edit code. There are many free and paid options. Today we'll use [Atom](http://atom.io).
        1. A modern web browser. Today we'll use Chrome.
        1. A local server setup. [Mamp](http://mamp.info) has been a go-to for many WordPress developers but today we'll be using the [DesktopServer](https://serverpress.com) app as this will reduce the need to manually create a database and streamline the WordPress installation process.
        
        If you're curious, read more about Mamp <!-- .element: class="footnote" --> [here](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/develop-wordpress-locally-mamp/).

        ## Installing WordPress with DesktopServer
        
        Open DesktopServer and let's follow the steps outlined in the getting started video.  
        The step by step written instructions and some additional info are also found [here](https://serverpress.com/getting-started-with-desktopserver/).  
        The LLC test site is named **llc-wp-workshop.dev** but yours can be whatever you want. Just not that for the remainder of this workshop, **llc-wp-workshop.dev** will be used in all examples.
        
        Note that your initial WordPress site may look different depending on which default theme your version of WordPress has included. More on this later. <!-- .element: class="footnote" -->

        ## Intro to PHP (11am)
        
        The default theme could use a little pizzazz and some personal customizations.  But before we get into where to find themes and how to update them, let's just go over some PHP basics.
        
        **How much PHP do you need to know?**
        
        That depends on the complexity of the customization but being able to recognize PHP and have a general grasp of the PHP syntax will help. Especially when reading the WordPress documentation. 
        
        Let's go over some PHP basics.
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## PHP Syntax

        PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions `<?php` and `?>` to jump in and out of “PHP mode”. PHP executed on the server generates HTML which is then sent to the client. Anything outside of the opening and closing tags will be ignored by the PHP parser.
        
        ```php
        <?php PHP code in between here. ?>
        ```
        ```
        <?php 
            Can also open & close the php tags on different lines.
        ?>
        ```

        If you mix PHP with HTML, an opening and closing tag is required for each PHP code block that is separated by non-PHP code.
        
        ```xml
        <p>This is just HTML and will be ignored by PHP.</p>
        <?php PHP code here. ?>
        <p>More HTML. Ignored by PHP.</p>
        <?php More PHP code here. ?>
        ```
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Outputting PHP
        
        There are two ways output content in PHP, `echo` and `print`.

        `echo` – output one or more strings, separated by a comma

        `print` – output only one string
        
        `string` - series of characters and needs to be contained in either single or double quotes.
        
        Add a semi-colon `;` after the string to end the command.
        
        ```
        <?php echo "I'm one string"; ?>
        <?php echo "I", "like", "pizza"; ?>
        ```
        ```
        <?php print "I'm one string."; ?>
        ```
        
        **Pro tip!**  In the previous example, if the single quotes were used, it would have a produced and error because PHP will think that the second quote closes the first one.  
        ```
        <?php print 'I'm one string.'; ?>
        ````
        
        You can avoid that by using double quotes or *escaping* it with a backslash `\` like so:
        ```
        <?php print 'I\'m one string.'; ?>
        ````

        ## Open Project files
        
        1. Open the Atom editor
        1. Open your new WordPress site project folder.  Unless you changed the path during the ServerPress setup, it should be located under **Documents > Websites**.  Click on your project's folder *once* and select **open**. Once open, the folder will show in your sidebar.
        
          ![](framework/img/workshop/open-project.png)
          
          (All of the files listed in **llc-wp-workshop.dev** are the WordPress *core* files that were added during the installation process.)
        1. Update the text wrapping option to make reading the code easier later on.  Go to **Preferences** and a tab will appear. Scroll down to **Soft Wrap** and make sure it's checked.

        ## Class exercise
        
        1. Create a new file in Atom - **File > New File**
        1. save it as **test.php** - **File > Save**
          It must end with a PHP extension (not .html) to be able to run PHP code.
        1. Let's add a line of HTML and PHP to compare.
          ```
          <p>Hello!</p>
          <?php echo "Hello!"; ?>
          ```
        1. Save it. To see this page we need to navigate to the **test.php** file but adding a forward slash `/` and the file name.
          
          ```
          http://llc-wp-workshop.dev/test.php
          ```
        1. Right-click / two-finder tap > View source

        ## Class exercise
        
        1. Update the code wrapping a paragraph tag around the PHP script and view source again.
          ```
          <p>Hello!</p>
          <p><?php echo "Hello!"; ?></p>
          ```
        1. Remember, with `echo`, you can output multiple strings by separating them with a comma.  
          ```  
          <p><?php echo "I", "like", "pizza."; ?></p>
          ```
        1. Let's make the output a little nicer by adding a space.  
          ```  
          <p><?php echo "I ", "like ", "pizza."; ?></p>
          ```

        ## Creating Dynamic Content
        
        Ok, that's great but how is that different than just writing HTML? HTML is static, it doesn't change.
        
        On your WordPress site, when you're logged in, there's an admin bar showing the site title and username that you entered when first creating the site.  It couldn't do that with just HTML!
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/wp-admin-bar.png)
        
        Variables can be used to store and retrieve this type of data.
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## PHP Variables
        
        To create a variable, *declare* it first. You get to decide what to name it but it must start with the `$` symbol and cannot contain spaces. Use camelCase or underscores. An `=` symbol is used to *assign* a value to the variable.
        
        In the example below, each of these variables would be interpreted as 3 different variables.
        
        ```
        $mygreeting = "Hello!";
        $myGreeting = "Hi!";
        $my_greeting = "Bonjour!";
        ```
        
        Variables only *store* values so it just sits there, waiting, until it's needed. Just like with the previous examples, you can use `echo` to output the variable value. **BUT** you do not need the quotes.  That is only required for string types.
        ```
        <?php
            $mygreeting = "Hello!";
            echo $mygreeting;
        ?>

        ## Functions (15mins - to 12pm)
        
        So far we've been outputting commands one line at a time but sometimes you need to group multiple commands together.
        
        [add everyday example/analogy]
        
        There are many functions built into the PHP language. For example, strlen() is used to return the length of a string.
        
        ```
        <?php echo strlen("Hello class!"); ?>
        ```
        
        This will return “12” since there are 12 characters, including the space, in the above string.

        To create your own, you must declare it using the function keyword.
        
        ```
        <?php 
            function my_function($parameter){
                //code to execute
            }
            
            echo my_function();
        ?>

        <?php if( has_post_thumbnail() ) ?>

        <?php get_sidebar(); ?>

        <?php get_template_directory_uri(); ?>

        # What is a CMS?
        
        A content management system (CMS) is an application used to edit content and manage a website using a graphical user interface. Web content can therefore be modified and published without editing the code or database.
        
        A CMS like WordPress also includes features such as:
        
        * database management 
        * themes and templates for page layouts
        * making content searchable and indexable
        * and much more!
        
        In addition to WordPress, there are many other CMS platforms as well, such as [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org).

        # What is PHP?

        * PHP requires a *server* to run so you can't just simply open a PHP file in your browser to see the content
        * has been around since 90s and originally stood for **Personal Home Page**, but now stands for **PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor** (Yep, that first “P” stands for PHP.)
        * can be written on its own or mixed with HTML
        * used to make a website *dynamic* and generate HTML 
        
        <!-- <br>
        **How much PHP do you need to know?**  
        
        This depends on the level of customization required. However, much of the customizations can be achieved using WordPress [template tags](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags) and are all documented in the Codex. -->

        #Local Development & server
        
        Developing your website *locally* refers to developing it on your computer.  It can only be viewed on your computer (or whatever computer your files are on).
        
        It's better to develop your site & make changes locally rather than on your live web server, so you get a chance to test it before the world sees it.
        
        Since WordPress runs on PHP, which is a server-side language, a *server* is needed to run the files before you can view the content in a web browser.

        ##Text Editor
        There are many [free and premium editors](http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/10-great-text-editors-web-designers-71412411) to choose from. Choose one that has features that help your workflow. Today we'll be using [Atom](http://atom.io).
        
        ##A web browser
        Using a [modern web browser](http://browsehappy.com/) will enhance your web experience as well as give you access to useful dev tools. Today we'll be using [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
        
        ##Local Server
        A local server setup will ensure that you can make edits locally. Today we'll be using the [DesktopServer](https://serverpress.com) app from ServerPress.  This app reduces the need to manually create a database and streamlines the WordPress installation process.

        Open the DesktopServer app and follow the steps outlined in the getting started video below. The written instructions and some additional info are also found [here](https://serverpress.com/getting-started-with-desktopserver/). Once you've created a local WordPress site, you can access it with the **Sites** button.

        Let's get acquainted with the WordPress Admin area. Getting to know the backend is key to theme customization.  
        
        When using a local server, `http://your-local-site.dev` is the domain. To access the Admin Area, just add `/wp-admin/` to the end. 
        
        ```
        http://your-local-site.dev/wp-admin/
        ```
        This works for any WordPress site you have admin access to, whether it's a live or local site.<!-- .element: class="note" -->
        
        If you're already logged in, you can also access it from the admin toolbar by selecting your site name. Click on it again to get back to your site.
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/admin-login.gif)
        
        **Pro tip!**  Open a new browser tab and navigate to your Admin area there.  That way you can have both your site and your Admin options open at the same time for easy access and testing.

        Here, you can view your drafts, check out basic stats, respond to comments and get a general overview of your blog.
        
        The other menus in the left sidebar allows access to additional settings such as adding blog posts (**Posts**), pages (**Pages**), changing themes (**Appearance**), uploading media (**Media**) and other general site settings.
        
        Note that any content or settings that you add in any of the Admin area options are stored in your database.  That's how the CMS retains the settings and content, even when you change the theme to update the site layout.

        # Exercise: Add some content (20mins) (finish by 11:20am)
        
        When designing a website, it's good to have some content before adding styles to add context to your page layouts. Follow the instructions below and refer to the [diagram](framework/img/workshop/admin-add-post.png) for more info.
        
        1. Add 2-3 **posts** (anything you want!)
          * include some paragraphs, headings and at least one image
          * add a **featured image** to at least 1 post
        1. Add a `Home` **page** and another 1-2 pages (e.g. About, Contact) 
          * include some paragraphs, headings and at least one image
          * add a **featured image** to at least 1 page
        1. Add a *blank* `Blog` **page** - just a page title and no content! We'll need this later.
        
        **Two posts**

        **Themes** are the overall design of the site. Included in every version of WordPress (and named after the year they were released in), are the default WordPress themes. You can also choose from 1000s of free and premium themes or create your own.
        
        **Customize** displays the custom options for a specific theme and will only be present if the theme author has configured the theme to allow this capability.
        
        **Widgets** are used to add various pieces of information to your theme's sidebar. (i.e. Categories, Archives, Recent Posts, etc.)

        **Menus** are used to create site navigation links to pages, categories, custom links, tags, etc.
        
        The **Header** & **Background** feature allows you to manage images  displayed in the header and the look of the background for your theme.  
        
        This option will only be present if the theme author has configured these options to allow for this capability.
        
        The **Editor** menu gives you access to edit the theme's PHP and CSS files but isn't the best way to edit the code. We'll be going over how to develop themes *locally* in Part 2 of this workshop.
        
        The content added in the previous exercise using the default Twenty Fifteen theme will look similar to [this](framework/img/workshop/theme-default-example.png).

        ##Option 1: Free & Premium Themes
        * only pay for domain, hosting & cost of theme (from free to a few hundred)
        * does not require any coding (though you still have access to the codebase)
        * includes some theme options that can be updated in the WordPress admin area
        
        ##Option 2: Child themes
        * used to modify a theme without making any changes to the parent theme’s files
        * inherits the features of its parent theme including updates
        * will require some knowledge of HTML, CSS and PHP 
        
        ##Option 3: Custom themes
        * built from scratch or from a "starter template"
        * requires a deeper knowledge of HTML, CSS, PHP or get really good at following
        the [WordPress documentation](https://codex.wordpress.org/)!

        ![](framework/img/workshop/custom-menu.png)
        
        `Home` - link to a page with some static content

        Go to the **Settings > Reading** menu to update these settings.

        When you upload plugins, themes & media files, they automatically get added to these folders.  
        
        You can also manage these files by directly adding or deleting files in the folders rather than using the WordPress admin menus.
        
        <!-- .element: style="clear:both;" --><br>**Important**!  
        When adding themes or plugins directly to these folders, the zip files need to be unzipped first. But they still need to be activated in the WordPress admin settings.

        Themes include multiple templates for displaying content.  For example, on a blog page, you might want to show a sidebar with links to recent posts and archives. 
        
        But you may not want to show a sidebar on the homepage.  You can change that in your page settings by choosing a template option.

        #Theme Template Files
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/theme-template.png)<!-- .element: class="left" -->
        Themes are a collection of [template files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/). Often, these templates are partial files and contain code for only a portion of a page. These partials fit together like a puzzle to generate full web pages.
        
        Since WordPress is based on PHP, the files are saved using a `.php` extension.
        
        Everything you enter into the Admin area (post content, site title, uploaded media, etc) gets stored in the *database* allowing you to update and modify themes without losing your content.

        #Theme Template Files
        
        Here are some common template files recognized by WordPress, based on the filename and template hierarchy. 
                
        * **index.php** - main template file and required in all themes
        * **style.css** - main CSS stylesheet and required in all themes
        * **comments.php** - template for display comments
        * **front-page.php** - used for a static front page / home page
        * **home.php** - default home page, shows latest blog posts
        * **header.php** - usually contains the  meta information, links to stylesheets and scripts and sometimes the site navigation.
        * **single.php** - used for a single post
        * **page.php** - template for single page
        * **404.php** - used when WordPress cannot find a post, page, or other content that matches the visitor’s request

        **How much PHP do you need to know?**
        
        Though WordPress is written in PHP, much of what you need to change or customize can be accomplished by following the documentation and using the WordPress **template tags**.  However, being able to recognize PHP tags and having a general grasp of the PHP syntax will help a lot. 
        
        The [entire PHP manual](http://php.net/manual/en/index.php) is available online and the WordPress documentation can be found here: https://codex.wordpress.org/
        
        <br>
        Before we get into the child themes, let's go over some PHP basics and get familiar with how the language works.
      </script>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # PHP Syntax

        PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions `<?php` and `?>` to jump in and out of “PHP mode”. PHP executed on the server generates HTML which is then sent to the client. Anything outside of the opening and closing tags will be ignored by the PHP parser.
        
        ```php
        <?php PHP code in between here. ?>
        ```
        ```
        <?php 
        Can also open & close the php tags on different lines.
        ?>
        ```

      </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # PHP Syntax & HTML 
        
        If you mix PHP with HTML, an opening and closing tag is required for each PHP code block that is separated by non-PHP code. This technique is used quite a bit in WordPress.
        
        ```xml
        <p>This is just HTML and will be ignored by PHP.</p>
        <?php PHP code here. ?>
        
        <p>More HTML. Ignored by PHP.</p>
        <?php More PHP code here. ?>
        ```
        
        You can even mix PHP between HTML tags.
        
        ```xml
        <p>More HTML. Dynamic code here: <?php PHP code here. ?></p>
        ```

        # Outputting PHP

        `string` - series of characters, contained in either single or double quotes  
        `echo` – output one or more strings, separated by a comma  
        
        Add a semi-colon `;` at the end of the command.
        
        ```
        <?php echo "I'm one string"; ?>
        <?php echo "I'm", "mutliple", "strings."; ?>
        ```
        
        **Pro tip!**  In the previous example, if single quotes were used, it would have a produced an error because PHP will think that the second quote closes the first one.  
        ```
        <?php echo 'I'm one string.'; ?>
        ```
        
        You can avoid that by using double quotes or *escaping* it with a backslash `\` like so:
        ```
        <?php echo 'I\'m escaping this string.'; ?>

        Once open, the folders and all its content will show in the sidebar.

        1. Create a new test file in Atom - **File > New File** and save it as **test.php**  
           It must end with a PHP file extension.
        1. Let's add a line of HTML and PHP to see how it renders in the browser.
          ```
          <p>Hello!</p>
          <?php echo "Hello!"; ?>
          ```
        1. Save it. (**File > Save**)
        1. To see this page, navigate to the **test.php** file but adding a forward slash `/` and the file name.
          ```
          http://your-local-site.dev/test.php
          ```
        1. Notice that the output looks the same in the browser (two lines of text).  
        **Right-click / two-finder tap > View source** in the browser to view the code.
        
        What's the difference between how the HTML and PHP gets rendered in the browser?

        All web page content should be written using HTML tags so when using PHP to generate content, be sure to include the generated content with the appropriate HTML tag.
        
        1. Update the code and add a paragraph tag around the PHP script. Your code won't look any different in the browser but if you view the source again, you'll now see both example text wrapped in HTML tags.
          ```
          <p>Hello!</p>
          <p><?php echo "Hello!"; ?></p>
          ```
        1. Remember, with `echo`, you can output multiple strings by separating them with a comma.  
          ```  
          <p><?php echo "I", "like", "pizza."; ?></p>
          ```
        1. Let's make the output a little nicer by adding a space.  
          ```  
          <p><?php echo "I ", "like ", "pizza."; ?></p>

        # Creating Dynamic Content
        
        Ok, that's great but how is that different than just writing HTML? 
        
        Remember, HTML is *static*, it doesn't change.
        
        When you're logged into WordPress, the admin toolbar appears and also shows your site title and username, using the data saved in the database.  
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/wp-admin-bar.png)
        
        It couldn't do that with just HTML! It changes *dynamically* based on which user is logged in or if and update has been made to that data (e.g. changed your site title).
        
        Variables can be used to store and retrieve this type of data.

        # PHP Variables
        
        To create a variable, *declare* it (name it) and give it a value. 
        
        You can name it whatever you want but it must start with the `$` symbol and cannot contain spaces. WordPress uses underscores, though PHP also accepts camelCase.
        
        An `=` symbol is used to *assign* a value to the variable.
        
        In the example below, each of these variables would be interpreted as 3 different variables.
        
        ```
        $mygreeting = "Hello!";
        $myGreeting = "Hi!";
        $my_greeting = "Bonjour!";

        Just like the previous examples, you can use `echo` to output the variable value. But you do **not** need the quotes.  That is only required for string types.
        ```

        # Class exercise: Variables
        
        Let's pretend we're creating the code for the Admin toolbar and create two variables for the website title and username.  
        
        Back in `test.php`, add your variables.  We won't be grabbing the actual database values for this example so just assign the value to the variable using a *string* value.
        
        ```php
        <?php 
        $site_title = "Ladies Learning Code";
        $username = "ladieslearningcode";
        ?>
        ```

        Now let's add some HTML with the PHP variables, to output these values onto the page.
        
        ```
        <a href="#"><?php echo $site_title; ?></a>
        <a href="#">Howdy, <?php echo $username; ?></a>
        ```

        # Functions
        
        A function is a reusable block of code, designed to accomplish a single task. Functions are useful because you can use it to execute repetitive tasks. There are many functions already built into the PHP language. For example, `strlen()` is used to return the length of a string.
        
        ```
        <?php echo strlen("Hello class!"); ?>
        ```
        
        This will return “12” since there are 12 characters, including the space, in the above string. 
        
        You can also create your own, by declaring it with the `function` keyword.
        
        ```
        <?php
        function greeting() {
          //code to be executed
          echo "Hello!";
        }
        
        greeting(); // call the function
        ?>
        ```
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Function arguments (2:30pm)
        
        You can pass information into functions using arguments.  Use a *parameter*, kind of like a placeholder, for the information that you want to manipulate. The syntax for the parameter is just like a variable.  Use the `$` symbol!
        
        Let's revise the previous function and add a parameter to hold a value for a name.
        
        ```
        <?php
        function greeting($name) {
          //code to be executed
          echo "Hello $name!";
        }

        greeting("Beyonce"); // call the function with an argument
        greeting("Blue Ivy");
        ?>

        #Wordpress Template Tags
        
        The great thing about WordPress is that many of the complexities required for displaying content have already been created in the framework.  These are referred to as **template tags**. Some common template tags are:
        
        * `get_header()` gets the header.php file and includes it in the current theme file. 
        * `get_footer()` tells WordPress to get the footer.php file
        * `the_title()` – tells WordPress to get the title of the page or post from the database
        * `bloginfo('name')` – tells WordPress to get the blog/website title from the database
        
        Notice that the syntax is just like the previous examples for calling a function because they are functions!  WordPress has extensive documentation in the [codex](https://codex.wordpress.org) for each tag.
        
        **Template tags** are used within themes to retrieve specific pieces of content from your database or to call output the contents of another theme file onto the page.

        #Template tags & template files
        
        How do the template tags and files all work together? In the **skt-white** theme folder, the **header.php** contains a line of code that looks like this:
        
            <h1><?php bloginfo('name'); ?></h1>
            
        `bloginfo('name')` will get the Site Title from the database, entered in your General Settings. 
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/blog-info-settings.png)<!-- .element: width="50%" -->
        
        Adding the template tag between an HTML tag outputs the title into the browser with the appropriate HTML and the data from the database.  The output will look like this in the browser:
        
            <h1>Ladies Learning Code</h1>

        <?php
            if ( condition ) {
                //code to execute

        #Child Themes 
        
        Why use a [child theme](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)?
        
        * great way to learn about WordPress theme development by reverse engineering existing code
        * recommended for modifying an existing theme
        * inherits the functionality and styling of parent theme and leverages existing code
        * make development faster since the main functionality, templates, etc, are already created
        
        If you modify a theme directly and it is updated, then your modifications may be lost. By using a child theme you will ensure that your modifications are preserved.

        #Making a child theme: Step 1
        
        In your theme folder, create a new folder for your child theme's files.
        
        It’s best practice to name the folder the same name as the parent, but with `-child` appended to it.

          #Making a child theme: Step 2
          
          Create a CSS file named **style.css**. 
          
          Your stylesheet **must** contain specific header comments at the very top of the file. This tells WordPress basic info about the theme, including the parent/child theme relationship.
            
          ```css
          /*
          Theme Name: The name of your theme
          Theme URI: http://www.yourthemewebsite.com/
          Description: A short description about your theme.
          Author: Name
          Author URI: http://www.authorwebsite.com
          Template: The parent folder name
          Version: 0.1
          */
          ```
        
          Only the **Theme Name** and **Template** is required. All of the other information is optional.

          #Making a child theme: Step 3
          
          Create a **functions.php** file. This file is used for adding features and functionality to a WordPress site. 
          
          In a child theme, a script is needed to enqueue the parent and child theme stylesheets.  Add the below script to your **functions.php** file.
          
          ```
          add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'theme_enqueue_styles' );
          function theme_enqueue_styles() {
              wp_enqueue_style( 'parent-style', get_template_directory_uri() . '/style.css' );
          }
          ```

        [Mamp](http://mamp.info) has been a go-to for many WordPress developers but today we'll be using the [DesktopServer](https://serverpress.com) app as this will reduce the need to manually create a database and streamline the WordPress installation process.

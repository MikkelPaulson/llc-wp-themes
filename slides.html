        ## What is a CMS?
        
        A content management system (CMS) is an application used to edit content and manage a website using a graphical user interface. Web content can be modified and published without editing the code or database.
        
        A CMS like WordPress also includes features such as:
        
        * database management 
        * themes and templates for page layouts
        * making content searchable and indexable
        * and much more!
        
        There are other CMS platforms as well, such as [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org).

      <script type="text/template">
        ## What is PHP?

        * PHP requires a *server* to run so you can't just simply open a PHP page in your browser like an HTML page
        * has been around since mid-90s and originally stood for **Personal Home Page**, but now stands for **PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor** (Yep, that first “P” stands for PHP.)
        * can be written on its own or mixed with HTML
        * used to make a website *dynamic* and generate HTML 
        
        <br>
        **How much PHP do you need to know?**  
        
        This really depends on the level of customization required. However, much of the customizations can be achieved using WordPress [template tags](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags) and are all documented in the Codex.

        ##Developing locally
        
        Developing your website *locally* refers to developing it on your computer.  It can only run and be seen on your computer (or whatever computer your files are on)!
        
        Since HTML is a *client-side* language, you can just open the file in your browser and swee your web page. But since WordPress runs on PHP, the PHP files need to run on a *server* before you can view the content in a web browser.
        
        It's better to develop your site & make changes *locally* rather than on your live web server, so you get a chance to test it before the world sees it.

        ## Setting up your dev environment
        
        ####Text Editor
        There are many [free and premium editors](http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/10-great-text-editors-web-designers-71412411) to choose from. Choose one that has features that help your workflow. Today we'll be using [Atom](http://atom.io).
        
        
        ####A web browser
        Using a [modern web browser](http://browsehappy.com/) will enhance your web experience as well as give you access to useful dev tools. Today we'll be using [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
        
        ####Local Server
        A local server setup will ensure that you can make edits locally. Today we'll be using the [DesktopServer](https://serverpress.com) app from ServerPress.  This app reduces the need to manually create a database and streamlines the WordPress installation process.

        ## Installing WordPress with DesktopServer
        
        <iframe class="left" width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Po0MkaL8Fgc" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        
        Open DesktopServer and follow the steps outlined in the [getting started video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po0MkaL8Fgc). The step by step written instructions and some additional info are also found [here](https://serverpress.com/getting-started-with-desktopserver/).  
        
        The LLC test site is named **llc-wp-workshop.dev** but yours can be whatever you want. Just note that for the remainder of this workshop, **llc-wp-workshop.dev** will be used in all examples.

        Once you've created a local site, you can also access it via the **Sites** button. **You will need to run this local server anytime you're developing WordPress locally.**

        ## WordPress Settings
        
        We're all set up!  
        
        Now let's look at the options in the [WordPress Admin](http://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/admin-area/) area and familiarize ourselves with the backend. Getting to know the site settings is key to theme customization.  
        
        When using a local server, `http://llc-wp-workshop.dev` is the website URL.   
        
        To get to the Admin Area, just add `/wp-admin/` to the end of your URL. This works for any WordPress site you have admin access to, whether it's a live site or local site.
        
        ```
        http://llc-wp-workshop.dev/wp-admin/
        ```

        If you're already logged in, you can also access it from the top admin bar by clicking on your site name. Click on it again to get back to your site.
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/admin-login.gif)
        
        **Pro tip!**  Open a new browser tab and navigate to your Admin area there.  That way you can have both your site and your Admin options open at the same time for easy access and testing.

      <script type="text/template">
        ## Dashboard > Home
        
        Logging into the admin area will automatically take you the the Dashboard Home page. 
        
        Here, you can view your drafts, check out basic stats, respond to comments and get a general overview of your blog.
        
        The other menus in the left sidebar allows access to additional settings such as adding blog posts (**Posts**), pages (**Pages**), changing themes (**Appearance**), uploading media (**Media**) and other general site settings.
        
        Also, note that *any* content or settings that you add in any of the Admin area options are stored in your database.  That's how it retains the settings and content, even when you change the theme to update the site layout.

        * strongly recommended to use the **Akismet** plugin to fight spam.   
        (More on plugins later.)

        ## Exercise: Add some content (20mins) (finish by 11:20am)
        
        In general, when building a website, it's good to have some content before adding styles (or in this case, changing the theme), to add context to your page layouts. Follow the instructions below and refer to the [diagram](framework/img/workshop/admin-add-post.png) for more info.
        
        1. Add 2-3 **posts** (anything you want!)
          * include some paragraphs, headings and at least one image
        1. Add a `Home` **page** and another 1-2 pages (e.g. About, Contact) 
          * include some paragraphs, headings and at least one image
        1. Add a **featured image** in at least 1 post and 1 page
        1. Create a *blank* `Blog` **page** - just add a page title and no content! We'll need this for later.
        
        **Two posts**

        [Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Themes_Screen) are the overall design of the site a can be changed without changing the underlying CMS functionality. Included in every version of WordPress (and named after the year they were released in), are the default WordPress themes. However, you can choose from 1000s of free and premium themes or create your own.
        
        [Customize](https://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Customize_Screen) displays the custom options for a specific theme and will only be present if the theme author has configured the theme to allow this capability.
        
        [Widgets](https://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Widgets_Screen) are used to add various pieces of information to your theme's sidebar. (i.e. Categories, Archives, Recent Posts, etc.)

        ![](framework/img/workshop/admin-appearance.png)

        **Menus** are used to  create a navigation menu of pages, categories, custom links, tags, etc.
        
        The **Header** & **Background** feature allows you to manage what image is displayed in the header and the look of background for your theme.  This option will only be present if the theme author has configured these options to allow for this capability.
      
        The content added in the previous exercise using the default Twenty Fifteen theme will look similar to [this](framework/img/workshop/theme-default-example.png).

        ##Theme Development options
        
        **Option 1: Free Themes & Premium Themes** 
        
        * only pay for domain, hosting & cost of theme (from free to a few hundred)
        * does not require any coding (though you still have access to the codebase)
        * includes some theme options that can be updated in the WordPress admin area
        
        **Option 2: Child themes**  
        
        * used to modify a theme without making any changes to the parent theme’s files
        * inherits the features of its parent theme including updates
        * will require some knowledge of HTML, CSS and PHP
        
        **Option 3: Custom themes**  
        
        * built from scratch or from a "starter template"
        * requires a deeper knowledge of HTML, CSS, PHP or get really good at following
        the [WordPress documentation](https://codex.wordpress.org/)!
        
        Let's explore option 1 first.

        ##Adding Themes from the WordPress directory

        There are literally 1000s of free WordPress themes available for download in the WordPress directory found under **Appearance > Themes**, **Add New**. Click on the thumbnail to see a preview, get info or install a new theme.
      
        For the next exercise, use the **Sydney** theme to see the same customization options referred to in the examples.
        
        Go to **Appearance > Themes**, select **Add New**. Search for the "Sydney" theme, select **Install** and **activate** when the installation is complete.

        Also, in this theme, the menu & header area will look different depending on your browser window size because this is a *responsive* theme.  For example, a bigger screen size will show a menu link, the smaller screen size will show an icon.

        Go to **Settings > Reading** menu to update the settings.

        To view all of the WordPress core files, go to **Documents > Websites**. (The default directory created during the DesktopServer setup.) All of the files listed in **llc-wp-workshop.dev** are the WordPress core files, added during the installation process.
        
        Though you can access all of these files, there are some that should never be edited.  The majority of your edits will be contained in the the **wp-content** folder.

        **Important**: When adding themes or plugins directly to the folders, the zip files need to be unzipped first, but still need to be activated in the WordPress admin settings.  Also, media is uploaded by date and will automatically create date specific folders.

        Themes include multiple templates for displaying content.  For example, on a blog page, you might want to show a sidebar with links to recent posts and archives. 
        
        But you may not want to show a sidebar on the homepage.  You can change that in your page settings by choosing a template option.

        ##Template Files
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/theme-template.png)<!-- .element: class="left" -->
        Themes are a collection of [template files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/). Often, these templates are partial files and contain code for only a portion of a page. These partials fit together like a puzzle to generate full web pages.
        
        Since WordPress is based on PHP, the files are saved using a `.php` extension.
        
        Everything you enter into the Admin area (post content, site title, uploaded media, etc) gets stored in the *database* allowing you to update and modify themes without losing your content.

        ##WordPress template files 
        
        Here are some common template theme files recognized by WordPress, based on the filename. See full list [here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Template_Files_List).
        
        * `index.php` - main template file and required in all themes
        * `style.css` - main CSS stylesheet and required in all themes
        * `comments.php` - template for display comments
        * `front-page.php` - used for a static front page / home page
        * `home.php` - If you do not set WordPress to use a static front page, this template is used to show latest blog posts
        * header.php - usually contains the  meta information, links to stylesheets and scripts and sometimes the site navigation.
        * single.php - template for a single post (not page). `index.php` is used if this template is not present.
        * page.php - template for single page
        * 404.php - used when WordPress cannot find a post, page, or other content that matches the visitor’s request
        
        All of these files are contained within the **wp-content** folder under **themes > theme-name**.

        ##Child Themes 
        
        We've already look at customizing themes via the WordPress admin options. Let's now explore digging into the code with child themes.
        
        Why use a [child theme](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)?
        
        * great way to learn about WordPress theme development by reverse engineering existing code
        * recommended for modifying an existing theme
        * inherits the functionality and styling of parent theme and leverages existing code
        * make development faster since the main functionality, templates, etc, are already created
        
        If you modify a theme directly and it is updated, then your modifications may be lost. By using a child theme you will ensure that your modifications are preserved.

        ##Intro to PHP (1:15)
                
        **How much PHP do you need to know?**
        
        Though WordPress is written in PHP, much of what you need to change or customize can be accomplished by following the documentation and using the WordPress **template tags**.  However, being able to recognize PHP structures and having a general grasp of the PHP syntax will help a lot. 
        
        The [entire PHP manual](http://php.net/manual/en/index.php) is available online and the WordPress documentation can be found here: https://codex.wordpress.org/
        
        <br>
        Before we get into the child themes, let's go over some PHP basics.
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## PHP Syntax

        PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions `<?php` and `?>` to jump in and out of “PHP mode”. PHP executed on the server generates HTML which is then sent to the client. Anything outside of the opening and closing tags will be ignored by the PHP parser.
        
        ```php
        <?php PHP code in between here. ?>
        ```
        ```
        <?php 
            Can also open & close the php tags on different lines.
        ?>
        ```
      </script>
      </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## PHP Syntax & HTML 
        
        If you mix PHP with HTML, an opening and closing tag is required for each PHP code block that is separated by non-PHP code. This technique is used quite a bit in WordPress.
        
        ```xml
        <p>This is just HTML and will be ignored by PHP.</p>
        <?php PHP code here. ?>
        <p>More HTML. Ignored by PHP.</p>
        <?php More PHP code here. ?>
        ```
        
        You can even mix PHP between HTML tags.
        
        ```xml
        <p>More HTML. Dynamic code here: <?php PHP code here. ?></p>
        ```

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Outputting PHP
        
        There are two ways output content in PHP, `echo` and `print`.

        `echo` – output one or more strings, separated by a comma

        `print` – output only one string
        
        `string` - series of characters and needs to be contained in either single or double quotes.
        
        Add a semi-colon `;` at the end of the command.
        
        ```
        <?php echo "I'm one string"; ?>
        <?php echo "I", "like", "pizza"; ?>
        ```
        ```
        <?php print "I'm one string."; ?>
        ```
        
        **Pro tip!**  In the previous example, if single quotes were used, it would have a produced an error because PHP will think that the second quote closes the first one.  
        ```
        <?php print 'I'm one string.'; ?>
        ```
        
        You can avoid that by using double quotes or *escaping* it with a backslash `\` like so:
        ```
        <?php print 'I\'m escaping this string.'; ?>
        ```

        **File > Add Project Folder** and click on your project's folder *once* and select **open**. Once open, the folders and all it's content will show in your sidebar.

          ```  
          <p><?php echo "I", "like", "pizza."; ?></p>
          ```

        ## Creating Dynamic Content
        
        Ok, that's great but how is that different than just writing HTML? 
        
        Remember, HTML is *static*, it doesn't change.
        
        On your WordPress site, when you're logged in, there's an admin bar showing the site title and username that you entered when first creating the site.  
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/wp-admin-bar.png)
        
        It couldn't do that with just HTML! It changes *dynamically* based on which user is logged in and uses the user data inputted during setup.
        
        Variables can be used to store and retrieve this type of data.
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## PHP Variables
        
        To create a variable, *declare* it first. You get to decide what to name it but it must start with the `$` symbol and cannot contain spaces. Use camelCase or underscores. An `=` symbol is used to *assign* a value to the variable.
        
        In the example below, each of these variables would be interpreted as 3 different variables.
        
        ```
        $mygreeting = "Hello!";
        $myGreeting = "Hi!";
        $my_greeting = "Bonjour!";
        ```
        
        Variables only *store* values so it just sits there, waiting, until you need it. Just like with the previous examples, you can use `echo` to output the variable value. **BUT** you do not need the quotes.  That is only required for string types.
        ```
        <?php
            $mygreeting = "Hello!";
            echo $mygreeting;
        ?>
        ```

        ## Functions (2:30pm)
        
        So far we've been outputting commands one line at a time but sometimes you need to group multiple commands together.
        
        [add everyday example/analogy]
        
        There are many functions built into the PHP language. For example, strlen() is used to return the length of a string.
        
        ```
        <?php echo strlen("Hello class!"); ?>
        ```
        
        This will return “12” since there are 12 characters, including the space, in the above string.

        To create your own, you must declare it using the function keyword.
        
        ```
        <?php 
            function my_function($parameter){
                //code to execute
            }
            
            echo my_function();

        ##Template Tags
        
        The great thing about using WordPress is that many of the complex functions that would be needed to display content have already been created in the framework.  These are referred to as template tags. 
        
        Note the syntax is just like the function we just created because they are!  WordPress has extentive documentation in the [codex](https://codex.wordpress.org) for each tag.
        
        Any content added in the WordPress backend Admin menus goes right into your database.  This includes content like your site title, blog post or page content to your menu settings and pretty much everything else you see on your site.
        
        **Template tags** are used within themes to retrieve specific pieces of content from your database or to call output the contents of another theme file onto the page.
        
        Some common template tags are:
        
        * `get_header()` gets the header.php file and includes it in the current theme file. 
        * `get_footer()` tells WordPress to get the footer.php file
        * `the_title()` – tells WordPress to get the title of the page or post from the database
        * `bloginfo('name')` – tells WordPress to get the blog/website title from the database

        ##Template tags & template files
        
        How do the template tags and files all work together?
        
        In the **skt-white** theme folder, the **header.php** contains a line of code that looks like this:
        
            <h1><?php bloginfo('name'); ?></h1>
            
        Remember, the `bloginfo('name')` template tag is used to get the site title from the database.  By including it between an HTML heading tag, it outputs the title into the HTML tag to creating a heading on the page and the data from the database.  The output look like this in the browser:
        
            <h1>Ladies Learning Code</h1>

      <script type="text/template">
        ## if statements?
        
        if/else Statements
        Note that in PHP, the syntax is elseif. (Not if else like in JavaScript).

        <?php
            if ( condition ) {
                //code to execute
            } elseif ( condition2 ) {
                //code to execute;
            } else {
                //code to execute
            }
        ?>
        Alternative syntax:

        <?php if ($a == 5): ?>
            A is equal to 5
        <?php endif; ?>
        <?php
            if ($a == 5):
                echo "a equals 5";
            elseif ($a == 6):
                echo "a equals 6";
            else:
                echo "a is neither 5 nor 6";
            endif;
        ?>

        what it is, why use it, examples
        
        When downloading themes outside of the WordPress directory, it will be provided as a zip file.  Go to **Appearance > Themes > Add new ** (Just like in the previous example) but not this time choose **Upload Theme** and update the zip file (don't unzip it!).
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/admin-themes-upload-1.png)
        ![](framework/img/workshop/admin-themes-upload-2.png)
        
        Any theme you upload, through the WordPress directory or manual upload will be added to your WordPress project files. 
        
        You can find it in **wp-content > themes** in your project folder.  You can also add or delete themes directly in this folder.  **BUT** if you add a theme here, then it needs to be unzipped first.

        mamp vs serverpress 
        [Mamp](http://mamp.info) has been a go-to for many WordPress developers but today we'll be using the [DesktopServer](https://serverpress.com) app as this will reduce the need to manually create a database and streamline the WordPress installation process.

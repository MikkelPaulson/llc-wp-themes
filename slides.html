    # What is a CMS?
    
    A content management system (CMS) is an application used to edit content and manage a website using a graphical user interface. Web content can therefore be modified and published without editing the code or database.
    
    A CMS like WordPress also includes features such as:
    
    * database management 
    * themes and templates for page layouts
    * making content searchable and indexable
    * and much more!
    
    In addition to WordPress, there are many other CMS platforms as well, such as [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org).

        # What is PHP?

        * PHP requires a *server* to run so you can't just simply open a PHP file in your browser to see the content
        * has been around since the 90s
        * originally stood for **Personal Home Page** but now stands for **PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor** (Yep, that first “P” stands for PHP.)
        * can be written on its own or mixed with HTML
        * used to make a website *dynamic* and generate HTML 
        
        <!-- <br>
        **How much PHP do you need to know?**  
        
        This depends on the level of customization required. However, much of the customizations can be achieved using WordPress [template tags](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags) and are all documented in the Codex. -->

        #Local Development & server
        
        Developing your website *locally* refers to developing it on your computer and can only be viewed on your computer.
        
        It's better to develop your site & make changes locally rather than on your live web server, so you get a chance to test it before the world sees it.
        
        Since WordPress runs on PHP, which is a server-side language, a *server* is needed to run the files before you can view the content in a web browser.

        ##Text Editor
        There are many [free and premium editors](http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/10-great-text-editors-web-designers-71412411) to choose from. Choose one that has features that help your workflow. Today we'll be using [Atom](http://atom.io).
        
        ##A web browser
        Using a [modern web browser](http://browsehappy.com/) will enhance your web experience as well as give you access to useful dev tools. Today we'll be using [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
        
        ##Local Server
        A local server setup will ensure that you can make edits locally. Today we'll be using the [DesktopServer](https://serverpress.com) app from ServerPress.  This app reduces the need to manually create a database and streamlines the WordPress installation process.

        Open the DesktopServer app and let's follow the steps outlined in the getting started video below or using the written instructions [here](https://serverpress.com/getting-started-with-desktopserver/). 
        
        Once you've created a local WordPress site, you can access it with the **Sites** button.

        Let's get acquainted with the WordPress Admin area. Getting to know the backend is key to theme customization.  
        
        When using a local server, `http://your-project-name.dev` is the domain. To access the Admin Area, just add `/wp-admin/` to the end. 
        
        ```
        http://your-project-name.dev/wp-admin/
        ```
        This works for any WordPress site you have admin access to, whether it's a live or local site.<!-- .element: class="note" -->
        
        If you're already logged in, you can also access it from the admin toolbar by selecting your site name. Click on it again to get back to your site.
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/admin-login.gif)
        
        **Pro tip!**  Open a new browser tab and navigate to your Admin area there.  That way you can have both your site and your Admin options open at the same time for easy access and testing.

        The other menus in the left sidebar allows access to additional settings such as:
        
        * adding blog posts (**Posts**)
        * adding pages (**Pages**)
        * changing themes (**Appearance**)
        * uploading media (**Media**)
        * other general site settings
        
        Note that the content or settings updates added in any of the Admin area options are stored in your database.  That's how the CMS retains the content, even when you change the theme.

        # Exercise: Add some content (15mins)
        
        When designing a website, it's good to have some content before adding styles to add context to your page layouts. Follow the instructions below and [refer to the diagram](framework/img/workshop/admin-add-post.png) for more info.
        
        1. Add 2-3 **posts** (anything you want!)
          * include some paragraphs, headings and at least one image
          * add a **featured image** to at least 1 post
        1. Add a `Home` **page** and another 1-2 pages (e.g. About, Contact) 
          * include some paragraphs, headings and at least one image
          * add a **featured image** to at least 1 page
        1. Add a *blank* `Blog` **page** - just a page title and no content! We'll need this later.
        
        Need some placeholder text or images?<br><!-- .element: class="note" -->

        **Themes** are the overall design of the site. Included in every version of WordPress (and named after the year they were released in), are the default WordPress themes. You can also choose from 1000s of free and premium themes or create your own.
        
        **Customize** displays the custom options for a specific theme and will only be present if the theme author has configured the theme to allow this capability.
        
        **Widgets** are used to add various pieces of information to your theme's sidebar. (i.e. Categories, Archives, Recent Posts, etc.)

        The **Header** & **Background** feature allows you to manage images  displayed in the header and the look of the background for your theme.  This option will only be present if the theme author has configured these options to allow for this capability.
        
        The **Editor** menu gives you access to directly edit the theme's PHP and CSS files but isn't the most intuitive way to edit the code. We'll be going over how to develop themes *locally* in Part 2 of this workshop.

        #More Themes
        
        Themes from outside of the WordPress directory can also be used and added by selecting the **Upload Theme** option. Downloaded themes are packaged as a zip file.  Do **NOT** unzip it when using this option; upload the entire zip file.

        Blog page templates generally default to include a sidebar with widgets (Recent Posts, Recent Comments, etc).
        
        Also by default, the homepage for all WordPress sites is a listing of your blog posts.

        By default, all WordPress sites show your latest blog posts as the home page. 
        
        But what if you wanted a navigation that looked like this:
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/custom-menu.png)
        
        `Home` - link to a page with some static content

Remember the Home and Blog pages we created earlier? We're going to use them now.

        The WordPress core files can be found under **Documents > Websites** (the default directory created during the DesktopServer setup). These files were added during the installation process.
        
        Though you can access all of these files, there are some that should never be edited.  The majority of your edits will be contained in the **wp-content** folder.

        There is one file outside of **wp-content** that you may need to edit. **wp-config.php** contains the website's base configuration details, such as database connection information.  When using the DesktopServer app, you do not need to edit this file to set up a local server but some other applications as well as adding certain customizations may require edits.

        When you upload plugins, themes & media files using the WordPress admin menus, they automatically get added to these folders.

        <!-- .element: style="clear:both;" --><br>**Important**!  
        When adding themes or plugins directly to these folders, the zip files need to be unzipped first. But they still need to be activated in the WordPress admin settings.

    Themes include multiple templates for displaying content.  For example, on a blog page, you might want to show a sidebar with links to recent posts and archives. 
    
    But you may not want to show a sidebar on the homepage.  You can change that by not including the sidebar code in your page template file or by creating additional custom page templates. 
    
    In the current theme, there are currently two custom options to choose from in additional to the default. Stick with the default template for now.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/theme-template.png)<!-- .element: class="left" -->
        
        Themes are a collection of [template files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/). Often, these templates contain code for only a portion of a page. These partials fit together like a puzzle to generate full web pages.
        
        Some templates are re-used across multiple pages such as the header and footer. Some are only used for specific conditions.
        
        WordPress is based on PHP so the files must use a `.php` extension.
        
        Content entered in the backend (posts, site title, media, etc) is stored in the *database* allowing you to update themes and keep your content.

        #Intro to PHP
                
        How much PHP do you need to know?
        
        Though WordPress is written in PHP, much of what you need to change or customize can be accomplished by following the documentation and using the WordPress *template tags*.  
        
        However, being able to recognize PHP tags and having a general grasp of the PHP syntax will help a lot. 
        
        Before we get into the child themes, let's go over some PHP basics and get familiar with how the language works.

        # PHP Syntax

        PHP code is enclosed in special start and end, `<?php ?>`, processing instructions to jump in and out of “PHP mode”. 
        
        PHP executed on the server generates HTML which is then sent to the client (the browser). Anything outside of the opening and closing tags will be ignored by the PHP parser.
        
        ```php
        <?php PHP code in between here. ?>
        ```
        ```
        <?php 
        Can also open & close the php tags on different lines.
        ?>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # PHP Syntax & HTML 
        
        If you mix PHP with HTML, an opening and closing tag is required for each code block that is separated by non-PHP code. This technique is used quite a bit in WordPress.
        
        ```xml
        <p>This is just HTML and will be ignored by PHP.</p>
        <?php PHP code here. ?>
        
        <p>More HTML. Ignored by PHP.</p>
        <?php More PHP code here. ?>
        ```
        
        You can even mix PHP between HTML tags.
        
        ```xml
        <p>More HTML. Dynamic code here: <?php PHP code ?></p>
        ```

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Outputting PHP

        `string` - series of characters, contained in either single or double quotes  
        `echo` – output one string or more, separated by a comma   
        Add a semi-colon `;` at the end of the command.
        
        ```
        <?php echo "I'm one string"; ?>
        <?php echo "I'm", "multiple", "strings."; ?>
        ```
        
        **Pro tip!**  In the previous example, if single quotes were used, it would produce an error because PHP will think the second quote closes the first one. 
        
        ```xml
        <?php echo 'I'm one string.'; ?> /* this will produce an error */
        ```
        
        You can avoid that by using double quotes or *escaping* it with a backslash `\` like so:
        ```
        <?php echo 'I\'m escaping this string.'; ?>

        1. Create a new file (**File > New File**) in your editor and save it as **test.php** in your root folder, to be able to find it easily.
  
          ![](framework/img/workshop/test-folder-directory.png)
        1. Use an HTML tag to enclose the PHP content. Use `echo` to output a message
          ```
          <p><?php echo "Hello!"; ?></p>
          ```
        1. Save it. (**File > Save**)
        1. To view this page, navigate to **test.php** by adding a forward slash `/` and the file name to the end of the URL. `http://your-project-name.dev/test.php`
        1. Remember, with `echo`, you can output multiple strings using commas. Try it!
          ```  
          <p><?php echo "I", "like", "pizza."; ?></p>
          ```
        1. Let's make the output a little nicer by adding a space after "I" and "like".  
          ```  
          <p><?php echo "I ", "like ", "pizza."; ?></p>
          ```

        ![](framework/img/workshop/view-source.png)
        
        Remember, since PHP is a *server-side* language, it gets parsed on the server first, then outputs onto the page. So even if you view the source in the browser (client-side), you won't see the PHP tags.

        Ok, that's great but how is that different from just writing HTML? 
        
        Remember, HTML is *static*, it doesn't change.
        
        When you're logged into WordPress, the admin toolbar appears and shows your site title and username, using the data saved in the database.  
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/wp-admin-bar.png)
        
        It couldn't do that with just HTML! It changes *dynamically* based on the information added by the user and stored in the database.
        
        Variables can be used to store and retrieve this type of data.

        # PHP Variables
        
        To create a variable, *declare* it (name it) and give it a value. 
        
        You can name it whatever you want but it must start with the `$` symbol and cannot contain spaces. WordPress uses underscores to separate words, though PHP also accepts camelCase.
        
        An `=` symbol is used to *assign* a value to the variable.
        
        Variables are case sensitive so the below example would be interpreted as three different variables.
        
        ```
        $mygreeting = "Hello!";
        $myGreeting = "Hi!";
        $my_greeting = "Bonjour!";

        Variables only *store* values so it just sits there, waiting, until you need it.

        ```php
        <?php 
        $site_title = "Ladies Learning Code";
        $username = "ladieslearningcode";
        ?>
        ```

        Then, output the PHP variables. 
        ```
        <a href="#"><?php echo $site_title; ?></a>
        <a href="#">Howdy, <?php echo $username; ?></a>
        ```
        
        They are wrapped in HTML anchor tags to output these values onto the page as a link. (The `#` is just a placeholder for the link location usually contained in the `href`.)

        # Functions
        
        A function is a reusable block of code, designed to accomplish a single task. Functions are useful because you can use it to execute repetitive tasks. There are many functions already built into the PHP language. For example, `strlen()` is used to return the length of a string.
        
        ```
        <?php echo strlen("Hello class!"); ?>
        ```
        
        This will return “12” since there are 12 characters, including the space.
        
        You can also create your own, by declaring it with the `function` keyword.
        
        ```
        <?php
        // declaring the function
        function greeting() {
          echo "Hello!"; // code to be executed
        }
        
        greeting(); // call the function
        ?>
        ```
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Function arguments
        
        You can pass information into functions with *arguments*.  
        
        Use a *parameter*, kind of like a placeholder, for the information you want to manipulate. The syntax for the parameter is just like a variable; use the `$` symbol.
        
        ##Class Exercise
        
        Let's revise the previous function and add a parameter to hold a value for a name.
        
        ```
        <?php
        function greeting($name) {
          echo "Hello $name!"; // code to be executed
        }

        greeting("Beyonce"); // call the function with an argument
        greeting("Blue Ivy"); // call the function with a different argument
        ?>
        ```

        #Wordpress Template Tags
        
        The great thing about WordPress is that many of the complexities required for displaying content have already been created in the framework.  These are referred to as **template tags**. Some common template tags are:
        
        * `get_header()` gets the header.php file and includes it in the current theme file. 
        * `the_title()` – tells WordPress to get the title of the page or post from the database
        * `bloginfo('name')` – tells WordPress to get the blog/website title from the database
        
        Notice that the syntax is just like the previous examples for calling a function? That's because they are functions!

        #Template tags & template files
        
        How do the template tags and files all work together? In the **sydney** theme folder, the **header.php** file contains a line of code that looks like this:
        
            <h2 class="site-description"><?php bloginfo( 'description' ); ?></h2>
            
        `bloginfo('description')` will get the **Tagline** value, entered in your general settings.
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/blog-info-settings.png)<!-- .element: width="70%" -->
        
        Adding the template tag between an HTML tag outputs the title into the browser with the appropriate HTML and the data from the database.

        #Child Themes 
        
        Why use a [child theme](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)?
        
        * learn about WordPress theme development by reverse engineering existing code
        * recommended for modifying an existing theme
        * inherits the functionality and styling of parent theme and leverages existing code
        * main functionality, templates, etc, are already created
        
        If you modify a theme directly and it is updated, then your modifications may be lost. By using a child theme your modifications will be preserved.

        #Making a child theme: Step 1
        
        In your theme folder, create a new folder for your child theme's files. Any theme can be used to create a child theme but this workshop will use the **sydney** theme in the remainder of the examples.
        
        It’s best practice to name the folder the same name as the parent, but with `-child` appended to it.
          
          ![](framework/img/workshop/child-theme-folder.png)

      <section class="slide" data-markdown>
        <script type="text/template">
          #Making a child theme: Step 2
          
          In your text editor, create a new file (**File > New File** or **command/control + N**) and save it as **style.css**. It has to be named *exactly* as **style.css** and saved in your child theme folder, **sydney-child**.
          
          Your stylesheet **must** also contain specific header comments, at the top of the file, to tell WordPress information about the theme, including the parent theme.
            
          ```css
          /*
          Theme Name: The name of your theme
          Theme URI: http://www.yourthemewebsite.com/
          Description: A short description about your theme.
          Author: Name
          Author URI: http://www.authorwebsite.com
          Template: The parent folder name
          Version: 0.1
          */
          ```
        
          Only the **Theme Name** and **Template** comments are required. The **Template** has to be the exact name of the parent theme's folder.  
          
          All of the other information is optional but commonly added.
          
          Here's the LLC project example:
          
          ```css
          /*
          Theme Name: LLC WordPress Workshop Project
          Theme URI: http://ladieslearningcode.com
          Description: This theme is used for demonstration purposes.
          Author: Ladies Learning Code
          Author URI: http://ladieslearningcode.com
          Template: sydney
          Version: 0.1
          */
          ```

      <section class="slide" data-markdown>
        <script type="text/template">
          #Making a child theme: Step 3
          
          Create a **functions.php** file. This file is generally used for adding features and functionality to a WordPress site. 
          
          For a child theme, a script is needed to enqueue the parent and child theme stylesheets. This will ensure that both the parent and child theme's CSS will load properly. Add the below script to your **functions.php** file.
          
          ```
          <?php
          
          add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'theme_enqueue_styles' );
          function theme_enqueue_styles() {
              wp_enqueue_style( 'parent-style', get_template_directory_uri() . '/style.css' );
          }
          
          ?>
          ```
          
          And that's it!

        Now that your child theme is all set up, how do you make changes?  Using pre-made themes are great because everything you need is already done.
        
        However, if you need to make changes, there's a little detective work required to figure out where to make the changes.
        
        Getting familiar with the various [template files](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Template_Files_List) and using the browser developer tools will help with narrowing down the search for content and making CSS updates.
        
        When getting started, be prepared to continuously refer to the [Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/) and a lot of trial & error!

        ##Template Hierarchy
        
        Some template files, (i.e. header & footer), are used on all of pages, while others are used only under specific conditions.

        The template *hierarchy* determines *which* template is used to display specific types of content for the different post types (pages, posts, custom posts, etc.)
        
        Let's look at the different templates & their place in the hierarchy and determine which template is most likely to contain the content we are looking to revise. 
        
        Note that for the next slide, "front page" refers to the page you see when you first go to your site (often referred to as home page or landing page).
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide no-bullet-list" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Editing Template files
        
        Here's a list of templates used to show page content:
        
        * **index.php** - main template file and required in all themes
        * **home.php** - shows latest blog posts index, whether it's set as the front page or not
          * this content will default to `index.php` if `home.php` does not exist
        * **page.php** - template for single (static) page type (i.e. About page)
        * **single.php** - single posts (not the index of posts but for each individual post)
        * **front-page.php** - used for the front page, whether set as static page or posts index
          * this template takes precedence over `home.php` 
          * if `front-page.php` does not exist, WordPress will either default to `home.php` or `page.php` depending on the setup in Settings → Reading. 
          * if neither `home.php` or `page.php` exist, it will default to `index.php`
        
        Based on this hierarchy, which templates do you think our Home & About is using?
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide no-bullet-list" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Template files & Hierarchy
        
        `page.php` is the template for single (static) page types. `index.php` can be used as well, but if `page.php` exists, it will take precedence.
        
        So our About and Home pages must be using the `page.php` template.
        
        BUT `front-page.php` could be also used be used for displaying the home page. However, in our current theme (Sydney), this template isn't included.  
        
        So... that leads us back to `page.php` as the best available option.
        
        Let's take a look at this file and do a simple test to confirm this is the correct template being used.

        (The template hierarchy is documented in the codex as well as in this [flowchart](framework/img/workshop/template-hierarchy.png).)

        #The Loop

        The Loop is used in WordPress for outputting content into the theme’s template files by retrieving each post to be displayed and how to formats it. That's how one template file can be used to handle multiple pages.
        
        The basic loop is:
        
        ```php
        <?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?>
            <?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>
              ... Display post content
            <?php endwhile; ?>
        <?php endif; ?>
        ```

        * the `have_posts()` function checks whether there are any posts (true/false)
        * this condition is true as long as there are posts
        * a `while` loop continues to execute as long as the condition in true
        * the while loops contains instructions for what content to display, from the posts
        
        ```php
        <?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?> // if we have posts
            <?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?> // while we have posts
              
              // add instructions here to pull out some or all of the content contained in the database for that post - usually with a combination of HTML & template tags
              
            <?php endwhile; ?> // end while
        <?php endif; ?> // end the if statement
        ```

        >Load a template part into a template. Makes it easy for a theme to reuse sections of code and an easy way for child themes to replace sections of their parent theme. 
        
        Looking further into the documentation, this basically means, look for a template file called `content-page.php`. This template tag allows you to create template files outside of the WordPress defined template files (`page.php`, `home.php`, etc).

        Open `content-page.php` in your editor and compare the code to the snippet we found when inspecting the page.

        Delete that little bit of code and poof! Header is gone! 
        
        Also, delete the "page.php template" test note in `page.php` now that we've confirmed that the correct file was being used.
        
        Since we're using a child theme, copy `page.php` and `content-page.php` and add it to your **sydney-child** folder to make the edits without revising the parent theme.

        Open `page.php` and make one more edit.  Let's get rid of the sidebar in the page template. No need to show archives & recent blog posts on a static page.
        
        At the bottom of `page.php`, there's this snippet:
        
        ```php

        That's another [template tag](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_sidebar), used to include the `sidebar.php` file. Delete it and the sidebar is gone from this template but still available for use on the blog page.
        
        You can also delete the whole `comments_template();` block if you don't want to include comments on your page template as well.

        #Child Theme: Editing Templates recap
        
        There is so much more you can do with theme customizations but the process is pretty similar to the process shown in the past examples.  
        
        1. decide what change to make 
        1. find the template file where content is being outputted
        1. make a copy and save it in your child theme folder
        1. revise the HTML & template tags/PHP as necessary
        
        To make CSS changes, getting to know the browser development tools will be super handy.  The good news is, you can make all your revisions in your `style.css` file and don't have to search for template files!

        #CSS Crash Course
        
        ##Syntax & terminology
        
        **Selectors** are used to determine which HTML element(s) to apply the styles to.
        
        **Properties** determine the type of style to be applied to the element (e.g. color). Values are specific to the property (e.g. red). 
        
        **Declarations** are style rules, written using `property:value` pairs, are wrapped by curly brackets `{}` and each must end with a semi-colon `;` to indicate that the instruction is complete.
        
        ```
        selector {
          property: value;
        }

        #CSS Examples
        
        ```xml
        <h1>Heading</h1>
        ```
        ```css
        h1 {
            font-size: 24px; /* selects all matching HTML elements */
        }

        ```xml

        .site-title {
            margin: 0px; /* selects all matching HTML elements with this class */
        }
        ```
        ```xml
        <h1 id="site-title">Heading</h1>
        ```
        ```css
        #page {
            color: #444; /* selects all matching HTML elements with this id */
        }

      <script type="text/template">
        #"Cascading" Style Sheets
        
        In CSS, they style rules "cascade" and are executed from top to bottom.
        
        For example, if you have use the same selector for two different declarations, the one that comes after will override the one that comes before.
        
        ```
        h1 {
          color: red;
        }
        
        h1 {
          color: blue;  /* this style will be override the previous declaration */
        }
        ```

        When setting up the child theme, the script used to enqueue the parent and child theme stylesheets ensures that the parent and child themes are loaded in such a way that the child theme css can override the parent theme css file.

        #Inheritance and specificity
        
        One of the strengths of CSS is styles can be inherited from parent to child elements using the family tree relationship between the elements.
        
        ```
        <body>
          <h1>My Website</h1><!-- child of body -->
          <p>This is a paragraph.</p><!-- sibling of h1 -->
        </body>
        ```
        ```
        body {
          color: blue;
          font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
        }
        h1 {
          color: black;
        }
        ```
        In the above example, the CSS properties in the body selector is inherited by the descendants elements (all nested elements). However, when a more specific selector is used (e.g. h1), it overrides the inherited values because it's more specific.

        #Change some CSS!
        
        Let's look at our blog page and change the font size and colour of the headings and paragraph.  You will need to open the browser developer tools to most effectively find the right selector to use.
        
        **Right-click > Inspect Element** to open the console.  Use the top left pointer icon to navigate and select the element and see the corresponding CSS on the right.

        #Change some CSS!
        
        For the title, there is a specific selector for that element, `.hentry .title-post`. We can use this selector to change the `font-size` (as well as the other properties).
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/inspect-css-h1.png)
        
        <!-- For the paragraphs, the styles are being *inherited* from the `body` selector.

        Open `style.css` from your child theme folder, **sydney-child**, in the text editor.
        
        Using the identified selector, make some changes!  Let's try updating the font-size and colour:
        
        ```css
        .hentry .title-post {
          font-size; 40px;
          color: #B109AA; /* LLC purply pink! */
        }
        ```

        #Update style.css
        
        Uh oh. How come only the `font-size` change is showing but not the color? 
        
        Inspecting the element shows that (1) the new css is being loaded and (2) the `font-size` is overriding the previous styles. But still no color change.
        
        **Hint**: See the arrow beside the `<h2>`? Click to open.

      <script type="text/template">
        #Update style.css 
        
        The color of this heading is set using a *different* selector that targets the link, inside of the `<h1>` tag. That's why our CSS addition wasn't working.

        #Update style.css 
        
        There seem to be multiple selectors being used to set the colour. How do you know which one to use?
        
        When inspecting the element, (1) shows as crossed out. That means something else is using a more specific selector and is overriding it. So, that means the selector shown in (2) should be used.  
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/css-change-2.png)

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Update style.css 
        
        This snippet below indicates that all of the links (`a`) contained within all of the headings (`h1, h2, etc`) will show the same colour by *combining* the selectors into a list separated by a comma.
        ```css
        h1 a, h2 a, h3 a, h4 a, h5 a, h6 a {
          color: #d65050;
        }
        ```
        
        If you only want to change the color for this specific heading, use just `h2 a` as your selector. Notice that when inspecting an element, the specific element being selected is highlighted when included in a list of combined selectors.
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/inspect-css-selectors.png)
        
        Update style.css with the new selector.
        
        ```css
        .hentry .title-post {
          font-size: 40px;  
        }
        h2 a {
          color: #B109AA; /* LLC purply pink!*/
        }

        #Child Themes & CSS Specificity
        
        You can still write your own CSS without inspecting the elements to find specific selectors, but based on the rules of CSS specificity, sometimes the style may not show as expected.
        
        Another option is to take advantage of the `body_class();` template tag. This is usually included in the `<body>` tag of the `header.php` template file like so:
          
        ```
        <body <?php body_class(); ?>>
        ```
          
        This template tag gives the `<body>` element different classes that can be used to apply the CSS specificity needed to override the parent theme's css.

        #Descendant Selectors & Specificity
        
        Descendant selectors can often be used to override other styles because of specificity rules.
        
        ```
        p {
          /* targets any paragraph anywhere on any page */
        }
        .blog p {
          /* targets only paragraphs contained in an element with a class of blog */
        }
        ```
        
        Our previous custom CSS looked like this:
        
        ```css
        .hentry .title-post {
          font-size: 40px;  
        }
        h2 a {
          color: #B109AA; /* LLC purply pink!*/
        }
        ```
        
        But we could also target the elements using with the body class selector, to create a more specific selector.
        
        ```css
        .blog .title-post {
          font-size: 20px;
        }
        .blog a {

        #Next Steps: Custom themes
        
        Phew! That was a lot of detective work.  Why not just write it all yourself?
        
        You can! 
        
        The main difference between using a child theme vs a custom theme is you'll have to make all those template files yourself including all the HTML, template tags, loops, css, etc. Or use a starter theme to get some basic functionality to start with.
        
        Also, custom themes involve making changes directly to the files. A "child" folder is not needed.
        
        Rule of thumb: Use a child theme if you only want to make some small basic changes. Use a custom theme if you need a lot of customization. 
        
        But keep in mind that custom themes, even when using a starter theme, will require a bit more HTML/CSS/PHP knowledge.

        #Next Steps: Plugins
        
        WordPress plugins are bits of software that can be uploaded to your WordPress site to extend the functionality of your WordPress site.
        
        Earlier, we recommended using [Akismet](https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/) plugin to help with spam comments.
        
        Adding functionality with Plugins range from adding social media buttons and  related posts, to Google Analytics to adding eCommerce options and everything in between.  
        
        Just like themes, not all plugins are created equal.  Browse for plugins in the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/popular/) and look out for things such as number of downloads, ratings and if it was updated recently.
        
        Plugins can be managed under the **Plugins** menu.

        Before going live, you'll need to register a domain name (www.mysite.com) and get hosting. Here are a couple domain & hosting suggestions:
        
        * [dreamhost.com](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?2085384) - Domain and hosting - Use coupon code **LLC40** to get $40 off your registration!
        * [hover.com](http://hover.com/ladiescode) - Domain registration

        Why keep your domains and hosting separate? Learn more about Hover [here](http://ladieslearningcode.com/getting-hosted-domains-with-hover/).
        
        After securing domain & hosting, you'll need to move your local files and database to the live server.

        ##What is WordPress?
        
        * one of many types of blogging software and CMS
        * used by many individuals and companies (ladieslearningcode.com is powered by WordPress!)
        * an online, open source (a.k.a. free) website creation tool 
        * written primarily in [PHP](http://www.php.net) and [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com)
        * uses PHP templates & a database to create and store content
        * used to create **dynamic** websites

        ##WordPress.com vs WordPress.org
        
        [WordPress**.com**](http://wordpress.com)
        
        * hosted and all technical maintenance handled by WordPress
        * has fewer options for customizing
        * do not need to edit the code
        * some paid upgrades available for some customization
        * no plugins
        
        [WordPress**.org**](http://wordpress.org)
        
        * provides the codebase for free to download & edit
        * requires you to purchase our own domain and hosting
        * you are responsible for the site maintenance
        * you have full control over theme files & code
        * plugins!
        
        Today we'll be exploring the **.org** version.

        ##Blog vs Website
        
        How are blogs different from standard websites?
        
        * the term *blog* is an abbreviation for *weblog*
        * blogs often contain an ongoing collection of posts and articles presented in date-based order
        * blogs are often (but not always) written in a diary-style commentary or first-person narrative
        * a website can contain both a blog section and standard informational web pages like an about or contact page
        
        WordPress started as a blogging platform but has since been a popular choice for many to create entire websites with.

        ## What is a CMS?
        
        A content management system (CMS) is an application used to edit content and manage a website using a graphical user interface.
        
        Web content can be modified and published without editing the code or database.
        
        A CMS like WordPress also includes features such as:
        
        * database management 
        * themes and templates for page layouts
        * making content searchable and indexable
        * and much more!
        
        There are other CMS platforms as well, such as [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org).

        ## What is PHP?
        
        <!-- HTML, CSS & JavaScript are examples of *client-side* languages. They run in the *browser*. -->

        * PHP is a *server-side* language
        * requires a *server* to run the commands so you can't just simply open a PHP page in your browser like an HTML page
        * has been around since mid-90s and originally stood for **Personal Home Page**, but now stands for **PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor** (Yep, that first “P” stands for PHP.)
        * can be written on its own, mixed with HTML, or used in combination with templating engines and frameworks like Wordpress
        * used to make a website *dynamic* and generate HTML

        ##Developing locally
        
        Developing your website *locally* refers to developing it on your computer.  It can only run and be seen on your computer (or whatever computer your files are on)!
        
        Since HTML is a *client-side* language, you can just open the file in your browser and swee your web page. But since WordPress runs on PHP, the PHP files need to run on a *server* before you can view the content in a web browser.
        
        It's better to develop your site & make changes *locally* rather than on your live web server, so you get a chance to test it before the world sees it.

        ## Setting up your dev environment
        
        ####Text Editor
        There are many [free and premium editors](http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/10-great-text-editors-web-designers-71412411) to choose from. Choose one that has features that help your workflow. Today we'll be using [Atom](http://atom.io).
        
        
        ####A web browser
        Using a [modern web browser](http://browsehappy.com/) will enhance your web experience as well as give you access to useful dev tools. Today we'll be using [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
        
        ####Local Server
        A local server setup will ensure that you can make edits locally. Today we'll be using the [DesktopServer](https://serverpress.com) app from ServerPress.  This app reduces the need to manually create a database and streamlines the WordPress installation process.

        ## Installing WordPress with DesktopServer
        
        <iframe class="left" width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Po0MkaL8Fgc" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        
        Open DesktopServer and follow the steps outlined in the getting started video. The step by step written instructions and some additional info are also found [here](https://serverpress.com/getting-started-with-desktopserver/).  
        
        The LLC test site is named **llc-wp-workshop.dev** but yours can be whatever you want. Just note that for the remainder of this workshop, **llc-wp-workshop.dev** will be used in all examples.

        Once you've created a local site, you can also access it via the **Sites** button. **You will need to run this local server anytime you're developing WordPress locally.**

        ## WordPress Settings
        
        We're all set up!  But the default theme and site settings could use a little personalization. Getting to know the site settings is key to theme customization.  Let's look at the options in the [Admin Area](http://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/admin-area/).
        
        When using a local server, `http://llc-wp-workshop.dev` is the website URL. To get to the Admin Area, just add `/wp-admin/` to the end of your URL.
        
        ```
        http://llc-wp-workshop.dev/wp-admin/
        ```
        
        This works for any WordPress site you have admin access to, whether it's a live site or local site.

        If you're already logged in, you can also access it from the top admin bar by clicking on your site name. Click on it again to get back to your site.
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/admin-login.gif)
        
        **Pro tip!**  Open a new browser tab and navigate to your Admin area there.  That way you can have both your site and your Admin options open at the same time for easy access and testing.

        Logging into the admin area will automatically take you the the Dashboard Home page. 
        
        Here, you can view your drafts, check out basic stats, respond to comments and get a general overview of your blog.
        
        The other menus in the left sidebar allows access to additional settings such as adding blog posts (**Posts**), pages (**Pages**), changing themes (**Appearance**), uploading media (**Media**) and other general site settings.
        
        Also, note that *any* content or settings that you add in any of the Admin area options are stored in your database.  That's how it retains the settings and content, even when you change the theme to update the site layout.

        **Posts**  
          * used for timely content, part of a series
          * listed chronologically by date
          * can also be assigned categories and tags <br>(also referred to as **taxonomies**)

        ###Media  
        
        The Media menu contains the option to add new media as well as view a library of all the media files you've uploaded to your site. This includes images, pdf, word docs, etc that have been added to your pages and posts. 
        
        ###Comments
        This is where you can see and manage all the comments left on your site. You can edit, update, delete or mark the comments as spam. If you decide to have comments on your site, it's strongly recommended to use a plugin like **Akismet** to fight spam. (More on plugins later.)
        
        If you'd like to disable or add specific restrictions to comments on your site, go to **Settings > Discussion** to see all the various options.

        ## Appearance
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/admin-appearance.png)
        
        This is where all the options related to the look and feel of your WordPress site is contained including themes and page components like menus, widgets and the page header.
        
        When first installing a WordPress site, the default WordPress themes are included with the core files. The latest (and default) theme is **Twenty Fifteen**. Themes contain pre-written template files that include page structure as well as page styles so layout can vary greatly based on the theme. 
        
        Adding content will help to visualize where each bit of content populates on the page.
        
        You can change & customize your theme from this section as well as add widgets and site menus.
        
        Basic content using the default Twenty Fifteen theme will look similar to  [this](framework/img/workshop/theme-default-example.png).

        ## Exercise: Add some content (20mins) (finish by 11:20am)
        
        In general, when building a website, it's good to have some content before adding styles (or in this case, changing the theme), to add context to your page layouts. Follow the instructions below and refer to the [diagram](framework/img/workshop/admin-add-post.png) for more info.
        
        1. Add 2-3 **posts** (anything you want!)
          * include some paragraphs, headings and at least one image
        1. Add a `Home` **page** and another 1-2 pages (e.g. About, Contact) 
          * include some paragraphs, headings and at least one image
        1. Add a **featured image** in at least 1 post and 1 page
        1. Create a *blank* `Blog` **page** - just add a page title and no content! We'll need this for later.
        
        **Two posts**

        There are literally 1000s of free WordPress themes available for download in the WordPress directory. For the next few exercises, let's all use the **Sydney** theme to ensure we see the same customization options.
        
        Go to **Appearance > Themes**, select **Add New**.  
        Do a search for the "Sydney" theme, select **Install** and **activate** when it's done.

        By default, the homepage for all WordPress sites is a listing of your blog posts (blog archive page).
        
        The items in the right sidebar (Recent Posts, Recent Comments, etc) are widgets and can be added or removed in the **Customize** option or directly under **Appearance > Widgets**.
        
        Also, in this theme, the menu & header area will look different depending on your browser window size because this is a *responsive* theme.  For example, a bigger screen size will show a menu link, the smaller screen size will show an icon.

        By default, all WordPress sites show the blog archive page as the home page.
        But what if you wanted a navigation to look something like this:
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/custom-menu.png)
        
        `Home` - link to a page with some static content  
        `About Us` - link to a page with some static info about you  
        `Blog` - link to a page showing all blog posts  

        These settings can be changed! Before creating a navigation menu, you'll need to select a **page** to be display as the home page and the blog.  (Remember the pages we created earlier?)
        
        Go to **Settings > Reading** menu to update the settings.

        But you may not want to show a sidebar on the homepage.  You can change that in your page settings by choosing a template option.

        Themes are a collection of template files. Often, these template files contain code for only a portion of a page and together, they make complete pages and websites.
        
        Since WordPress is based on PHP, the files are saved using a `.php` extension.
        
        Everything you enter into the Admin area (post content, site title, uploaded media, etc) gets stored in the *database* allowing you to update and modify themes without losing your content.

        ##Uploading Themes 
        
        You can also use themes from outside of the WordPress directory but note that not all themes are created equal!  
        
        Downloaded themes are packaged as a zip file.  Do **NOT** unzip them when uploading via the WordPress admin panel. Included in today's learner files is a zip file,   **skt-white.zip**, contained in the **exercise-files** folder. Let's use that for the next exercise.

        To view the WordPress core files, go to **Documents > Websites**. (The default directory created during the DesktopServer setup.) 
        
        All of the files listed in **llc-wp-workshop.dev** are the WordPress core files, added during the installation process.
        
        Though you can access all of the core files, there are some files that should never be edited.  The majority of your edits will be contained in the the **wp-content** folder.

        When you upload plugins, themes & media files, they automatically get added to these folders.  You can also manage these files by directly adding or deleting files in the folders rather than using the WordPress admin area.
        
        **Important**: When adding themes or plugins directly to the folders, the zip files need to be unzipped first, but still need to be activated in the WordPress admin settings.  Also, media is uploaded by date and will automatically create date specific folders.

        The default theme could use a little pizzazz and some personal customizations.  But before we get into where to find themes and how to update them, let's just go over some PHP basics.
        
        **How much PHP do you need to know?**
        
        That depends on the complexity of the customization but being able to recognize PHP structures and having a general grasp of the PHP syntax will help. Especially when reading the WordPress documentation. 
        
        The [entire PHP manual](http://php.net/manual/en/index.php) is available online for your reference.

        ## PHP Syntax

        PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions `<?php` and `?>` to jump in and out of “PHP mode”. PHP executed on the server generates HTML which is then sent to the client. Anything outside of the opening and closing tags will be ignored by the PHP parser.
        
        ```php
        <?php PHP code in between here. ?>
        ```
        ```
        <?php 
            Can also open & close the php tags on different lines.

      <script type="text/template">
        ## PHP Syntax & HTML 
        
        If you mix PHP with HTML, an opening and closing tag is required for each PHP code block that is separated by non-PHP code. This technique is used quite a bit in WordPress.
        
        ```xml
        <p>This is just HTML and will be ignored by PHP.</p>
        <?php PHP code here. ?>
        <p>More HTML. Ignored by PHP.</p>
        <?php More PHP code here. ?>
        ```
        
        You can even mix PHP between HTML tags.
        
        ```xml
        <p>More HTML. Dynamic code here: <?php PHP code here. ?></p>
        ```

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Outputting PHP
        
        There are two ways output content in PHP, `echo` and `print`.

        `echo` – output one or more strings, separated by a comma

        `print` – output only one string
        
        `string` - series of characters and needs to be contained in either single or double quotes.
        
        Add a semi-colon `;` after the string to end the command.
        
        ```
        <?php echo "I'm one string"; ?>
        <?php echo "I", "like", "pizza"; ?>
        ```
        ```
        <?php print "I'm one string."; ?>
        ```
        
        **Pro tip!**  In the previous example, if the single quotes were used, it would have a produced and error because PHP will think that the second quote closes the first one.  
        ```
        <?php print 'I'm one string.'; ?>
        ````
        
        You can avoid that by using double quotes or *escaping* it with a backslash `\` like so:
        ```
        <?php print 'I\'m one string.'; ?>
        ````

          It must end with a PHP extension (not .html) to be able to run PHP code.

          ```
        1. Remember, with `echo`, you can output multiple strings by separating them with a comma.  
          ```  
          <p><?php echo "I", "like", "pizza."; ?></p>
          ```
        1. Let's make the output a little nicer by adding a space.

        ## Creating Dynamic Content
        
        Ok, that's great but how is that different than just writing HTML? 
        
        Remember, HTML is *static*, it doesn't change.
        
        On your WordPress site, when you're logged in, there's an admin bar showing the site title and username that you entered when first creating the site.  
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/wp-admin-bar.png)
        
        It couldn't do that with just HTML! It changes *dynamically* based on which user is logged in and uses the user data inputted during setup.
        
        Variables can be used to store and retrieve this type of data.
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## PHP Variables
        
        To create a variable, *declare* it first. You get to decide what to name it but it must start with the `$` symbol and cannot contain spaces. Use camelCase or underscores. An `=` symbol is used to *assign* a value to the variable.
        
        In the example below, each of these variables would be interpreted as 3 different variables.
        
        ```
        $mygreeting = "Hello!";
        $myGreeting = "Hi!";
        $my_greeting = "Bonjour!";
        ```
        
        Variables only *store* values so it just sits there, waiting, until you need it. Just like with the previous examples, you can use `echo` to output the variable value. **BUT** you do not need the quotes.  That is only required for string types.
        ```
        <?php
            $mygreeting = "Hello!";
            echo $mygreeting;
        ?>

        ## Functions (15mins - to 12pm)
        
        So far we've been outputting commands one line at a time but sometimes you need to group multiple commands together.
        
        [add everyday example/analogy]
        
        There are many functions built into the PHP language. For example, strlen() is used to return the length of a string.
        
        ```
        <?php echo strlen("Hello class!"); ?>
        ```
        
        This will return “12” since there are 12 characters, including the space, in the above string.

        To create your own, you must declare it using the function keyword.
        
        ```
        <?php 
            function my_function($parameter){
                //code to execute
            }
            
            echo my_function();
        ?>

        ## WordPress template tags
        
        The great thing about using WordPress is that many of the complex functions that would be needed to display content have already been created in the framework.  These are referred to as template tags. 
        
        Note the syntax is just like the function we just created because they are!  WordPress has extentive documentation in the [codex](https://codex.wordpress.org) for each tag.
        
        Here's some common ones we'll look at today:
        
        ```
        <?php the_title(); ?>

        <!-- <?php if( has_post_thumbnail() ) ?> -->

        <?php get_sidebar(); ?>

        <?php get_template_directory_uri(); ?>

        if/else Statements

        <?php
            if ( condition ) {
                //code to execute
            } elseif ( condition2 ) {

        what it is, why use it, examples
        
        When downloading themes outside of the WordPress directory, it will be provided as a zip file.  Go to **Appearance > Themes > Add new ** (Just like in the previous example) but not this time choose **Upload Theme** and update the zip file (don't unzip it!).
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/admin-themes-upload-1.png)
        ![](framework/img/workshop/admin-themes-upload-2.png)
        
        Any theme you upload, through the WordPress directory or manual upload will be added to your WordPress project files. 
        
        You can find it in **wp-content > themes** in your project folder.  You can also add or delete themes directly in this folder.  **BUT** if you add a theme here, then it needs to be unzipped first.

        mamp vs serverpress 
        [Mamp](http://mamp.info) has been a go-to for many WordPress developers but today we'll be using the [DesktopServer](https://serverpress.com) app as this will reduce the need to manually create a database and streamline the WordPress installation process.
        
        If you're curious, read more about Mamp <!-- .element: class="footnote" --> [here](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/develop-wordpress-locally-mamp/).

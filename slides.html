        ##What is WordPress?
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/wp-logo.png)
        
        * one of many types of blogging software and CMS
        * used by many individuals and companies (ladieslearningcode.com is powered by WordPress!)
        * an online, open source (a.k.a. free) website creation tool 
        * written primarily in [PHP](http://www.php.net) and [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com)
        * uses PHP templates & a database to create and store content
        * used to create **dynamic** websites
        
        <br>
        It's important to note that the learning curve may feel steep in comparison to HTML & CSS. However, the amount and complexity of the code editing will depend on your needs and level of customization.

        ## What is a CMS?
        
        A content management system (CMS), is an application used to edit content and manage a website using a graphical user interface.
        
        Web content can be modified and published without editing the code or database.
        
        A CMS like WordPress also includes features such as:
        
        * database management 
        * themes and templates for page layouts
        * making content searchable and indexable
        * and much more!
        
        There are other CMS platforms as well, such as [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org).

        ## What is PHP?
        
        HTML, CSS & JavaScript are examples of *client-side* languages. They run in the *browser*.

        PHP is a *server-side* language and runs in the *web server*. PHP development began in the mid-90s and originally stood for Personal Home Page, but now stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. (Yep, that first “P” stands for PHP.)

        PHP requires a *server* to run the commands so you can't just simply open a PHP page in your browser like an HTML page.

        PHP code can be written on its own, mixed with HTML, or used in combination with many templating engines and frameworks like Wordpress.

        PHP can be used to make a website *dynamic*. PHP can generate HTML, and HTML can pass information to PHP so if you view source on the Ladies Learning Code site, you cannot see the PHP code, even though it's being used to run the WordPress code base.

        ##Blog vs Website
        
        How are blogs different from standard websites?
        
        * the term *blog* is an abbreviation for *weblog*
        * blogs often contain an ongoing collection of posts and articles presented in date-based order
        * blogs are often (but not always) written in a diary-style commentary or first-person narrative
        * a website can contain both blog section and standard informational web pages like an about or contact page
        
        WordPress started as primarily a blogging platform but has since been a choice for many as the platform to create entire websites on.

        [WordPress**.com**](http://wordpress.com)

        * has fewer options for customizing
        * do not need to edit the code
        * some paid upgrades available for some customization
        * no plugins
        
        [WordPress**.org**](http://wordpress.org)
        
        * provides the codebase for free to download & edit
        * requires you to purchase our own domain and hosting
        * You are responsible for the site maintenance
        * you get full control over theme files & code

        ##Developing locally
        
        Developing your website *locally*, whether it's WordPress or any other programming language, means developing it on your computer.  It can only run and be seen on your computer (or whatever computer your files are on)!
        
        Since HTML is a *client-side* language, you can just open the file in your browser but since WordPress runs on PHP, the PHP files need to run on a *server* before you can view the content in a web browser.
        
        It's better to develop your site & makde changes *locally* rather than on your live web server, so you get a chance to test it before the world sees it.

        ## Setting up your dev environment
        
        What will you need?
        
        1. A text editor to write & edit code. There are many free and paid options. Today we'll use [Atom](http://atom.io).
        1. A modern web browser. Today we'll use Chrome.
        1. A local server setup. [Mamp](http://mamp.info) has been a go-to for many WordPress developers but today we'll be using the [DesktopServer](https://serverpress.com) app as this will reduce the need to manually create a database and streamline the WordPress installation process.
        
        If you're curious, read more about Mamp <!-- .element: class="footnote" --> [here](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/develop-wordpress-locally-mamp/).

        ## Installing WordPress with DesktopServer
        
        Open DesktopServer and let's follow the steps outlined in the getting started video.  
        The step by step written instructions and some additional info are also found [here](https://serverpress.com/getting-started-with-desktopserver/).  
        The LLC test site is named **llc-wp-workshop.dev** but yours can be whatever you want. Just not that for the remainder of this workshop, **llc-wp-workshop.dev** will be used in all examples.
        
        Note that your initial WordPress site may look different depending on which default theme your version of WordPress has included. More on this later. <!-- .element: class="footnote" -->

        ## Intro to PHP (11am)
        
        The default theme could use a little pizzazz and some personal customizations.  But before we get into where to find themes and how to update them, let's just go over some PHP basics.
        
        **How much PHP do you need to know?**
        
        That depends on the complexity of the customization but being able to recognize PHP structures and having a general grasp of the PHP syntax will help. Especially when reading the WordPress documentation. 
        
        The [entire PHP manual](http://php.net/manual/en/index.php) is available online for your reference.

      <script type="text/template">
        ## PHP Syntax

        PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions `<?php` and `?>` to jump in and out of “PHP mode”. PHP executed on the server generates HTML which is then sent to the client. Anything outside of the opening and closing tags will be ignored by the PHP parser.
        
        ```php
        <?php PHP code in between here. ?>
        ```
        ```
        <?php 
            Can also open & close the php tags on different lines.
        ?>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## PHP Syntax & HTML 
        
        If you mix PHP with HTML, an opening and closing tag is required for each PHP code block that is separated by non-PHP code. This technique is used quite a bit in WordPress.
        
        ```xml
        <p>This is just HTML and will be ignored by PHP.</p>
        <?php PHP code here. ?>
        <p>More HTML. Ignored by PHP.</p>
        <?php More PHP code here. ?>
        ```
        
        You can even mix PHP between HTML tags.
        
        ```xml
        <p>More HTML. Dynamic code here: <?php PHP code here. ?></p>
        ```

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Outputting PHP
        
        There are two ways output content in PHP, `echo` and `print`.

        `echo` – output one or more strings, separated by a comma

        `print` – output only one string
        
        `string` - series of characters and needs to be contained in either single or double quotes.
        
        Add a semi-colon `;` after the string to end the command.
        
        ```
        <?php echo "I'm one string"; ?>
        <?php echo "I", "like", "pizza"; ?>
        ```
        ```
        <?php print "I'm one string."; ?>
        ```
        
        **Pro tip!**  In the previous example, if the single quotes were used, it would have a produced and error because PHP will think that the second quote closes the first one.  
        ```
        <?php print 'I'm one string.'; ?>
        ````
        
        You can avoid that by using double quotes or *escaping* it with a backslash `\` like so:
        ```
        <?php print 'I\'m one string.'; ?>
        ````

        ## Open Project files
        
        1. Open the Atom editor
        1. Open your new WordPress site project folder.  Unless you changed the path during the ServerPress setup, it should be located under **Documents > Websites**.  Click on your project's folder *once* and select **open**. Once open, the folder will show in your sidebar.
        
          ![](framework/img/workshop/open-project.png)
          
          (All of the files listed in **llc-wp-workshop.dev** are the WordPress *core* files that were added during the installation process.)
        1. Update the text wrapping option in Atom to make reading the code easier later on.  Go to **Preferences** and a tab will appear. Scroll down to **Soft Wrap** and make sure it's checked.

        ## Class exercise
        
        1. Create a new file in Atom - **File > New File**
        1. save it as **test.php** - **File > Save**
          It must end with a PHP extension (not .html) to be able to run PHP code.
        1. Let's add a line of HTML and PHP to compare.
          ```
          <p>Hello!</p>
          <?php echo "Hello!"; ?>
          ```
        1. Save it. To see this page we need to navigate to the **test.php** file but adding a forward slash `/` and the file name.
          
          ```
          http://llc-wp-workshop.dev/test.php
          ```
        1. Right-click / two-finder tap > View source
        
        Where's the php?

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Class exercise
        
        1. Update the code wrapping a paragraph tag around the PHP script and view source again.
          ```
          <p>Hello!</p>
          <p><?php echo "Hello!"; ?></p>
          ```
        1. Remember, with `echo`, you can output multiple strings by separating them with a comma.  
          ```  
          <p><?php echo "I", "like", "pizza."; ?></p>
          ```
        1. Let's make the output a little nicer by adding a space.  
          ```  
          <p><?php echo "I ", "like ", "pizza."; ?></p>
          ```

        ## Creating Dynamic Content
        
        Ok, that's great but how is that different than just writing HTML? 
        
        Remember, HTML is *static*, it doesn't change.
        
        On your WordPress site, when you're logged in, there's an admin bar showing the site title and username that you entered when first creating the site.  
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/wp-admin-bar.png)
        
        It couldn't do that with just HTML! It changes *dynamically* based on which user is logged in and uses the user data inputted during setup.
        
        Variables can be used to store and retrieve this type of data.
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## PHP Variables
        
        To create a variable, *declare* it first. You get to decide what to name it but it must start with the `$` symbol and cannot contain spaces. Use camelCase or underscores. An `=` symbol is used to *assign* a value to the variable.
        
        In the example below, each of these variables would be interpreted as 3 different variables.
        
        ```
        $mygreeting = "Hello!";
        $myGreeting = "Hi!";
        $my_greeting = "Bonjour!";
        ```
        
        Variables only *store* values so it just sits there, waiting, until you need it. Just like with the previous examples, you can use `echo` to output the variable value. **BUT** you do not need the quotes.  That is only required for string types.
        ```
        <?php
            $mygreeting = "Hello!";
            echo $mygreeting;
        ?>

        [add everyday example/analogy]
        
        There are many functions built into the PHP language. For example, strlen() is used to return the length of a string.
        
        ```
        <?php echo strlen("Hello class!"); ?>
        ```
        
        This will return “12” since there are 12 characters, including the space, in the above string.

        To create your own, you must declare it using the function keyword.
        
        ```
        <?php 
            function my_function($parameter){
                //code to execute
            }
            
            echo my_function();
        ?>
        ```
      </script>

        ## WordPress template tags
        
        The great thing about using WordPress is that many of the complex functions that would be needed to display content have already been created in the framework.  These are referred to as template tags. 
        
        Note the syntax is just like the function we just created because they are!  WordPress has extentive documentation in the [codex](https://codex.wordpress.org) for each tag.
        
        Here's some common ones we'll look at today:
        
        ```
        <?php the_title(); ?>

        <!-- <?php if( has_post_thumbnail() ) ?> -->

        <?php get_sidebar(); ?>

        <?php get_template_directory_uri(); ?>
        ```
        
        Let's get back into WordPress!
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## if statements?
        
        if/else Statements
        Note that in PHP, the syntax is elseif. (Not if else like in JavaScript).

        <?php
            if ( condition ) {
                //code to execute
            } elseif ( condition2 ) {
                //code to execute;
            } else {
                //code to execute
            }
        ?>
        Alternative syntax:

        <?php if ($a == 5): ?>
            A is equal to 5
        <?php endif; ?>
        <?php
            if ($a == 5):
                echo "a equals 5";
            elseif ($a == 6):
                echo "a equals 6";
            else:
                echo "a is neither 5 nor 6";
            endif;
        ?>

        ##Accessing the dashboard
        
        When using the DeskTop server app and a local server **http://llc-wp-workshop.dev** is your website's URL. To ge to the Dashboard, add `/wp-admin/` to the end of your URL like so:
        
        ```
        http://llc-wp-workshop.dev/wp-admin/
        ```
        
        or from the admin bar, select **Your site name > Dashboard**
        
        **Pro tip!**  Open a new browser tab and navigate to your Dashboard there.  That way you can have both your site and your Admin options open at the same time for easy access and testing.

        ## Dashboard: Home
        
        Logging into the admin area will automatically take you the the Dashboard Home page. Here, you can view your drafts, check out basic stats, respond to comments and get a general overview of your blog.
        
        The Dashboard menus in the left sidebar allows access to additional settings such as adding blog posts (**Posts**), pages (**Pages**), changing themes (**Appearance**), uploading media (**Media**) and other general site settings.
        
        Let's go over some of these options in more detail.

        ## Posts vs Pages
        
        Post and pages are both used for adding content to the site and the content is stored in the database.
        
        **Posts** are used for blog posts, which are display chronologically based on the post date. It can also be assigned categories and tags.
        
        **Pages** are used for single pages of static content such as an about or contact page. They are not assigned to categories and tags.

        ##Media & Comments
        
        ###Media  
        
        This Media library allows you to see all the media files you've uploaded to your site.        This includes images, pdf, word docs, etc that have been added to your pages/posts, image galleries or for later use.
        
        ###Comments
        When people leave comments on your site, you will find them listed under the **Comments** menu. You can edit comments, update, delete or mark them as spam.
        If you decide to have comments on your site, it's strongly recommended to use a plugin like **Akismet** to fight spam. (More on plugins later.)

        ## Exercise: Add some content (15mins)
        
        When building a website, it's good to have some content to add context to your page layouts.  Take some time add 2-3 posts (anything you want!) and 1-2 pages (e.g. About, Contact) for your site.  Adding posts and pages are the same except the default **permalink** (URL of page or post) for posts will include the date.
        
        Make sure to have paragraphs, a couple headings, a featured image and an image in at least one post or page.  Must select **Update**.  Stick to **Standard format** for now.
        
        Use the Twenty Fifteen theme for now so we can see the same thing.

        This is where all the options for the look and feel of your WordPress site is contained. 
        
        Themes contain pre-written template files that include page structure as well as page styles. You can change & customize your theme from this section as well as add widgets and site menus.

        ## Theme options
        
        There are three types of themes available for use. The deciding factors will depend on level of programming knowledge, client needs, timing and budget.

        Level 1: Free/Premium theme
        These are pre-written themes that already define look, feel, page layouts and functionality and will usually contain some customization options that can be updated in the WordPress admin interface and will not require any coding.  Usually paid premium themes will offer more customizations and customer support.
        
        Level 2: Child theme
        If you find a theme that you mostly like but just want to change a few details, a Child theme is great for making smaller changes without changing the core files of the parent theme.
        
        Level 3: Custom theme
        Totally built from scratch.  There are many bare-bones "starter templates" to help get you started with some basic functionality but still is mostly fully customized by you.
        
        We'll go over these in more detail throughout the remainder of the course.  Let's start with using Free/Premium themes.
        The default WordPress themes are pre-install but you can add other themes.
        
        Let's look at the **Theme** option first.

        ## Finding Themes in the WordPress Directory
        There are literally 1000s of free WordPress themes available for download in the WordPress directory.

        ## Finding Themes elsewhere
        You can also find and add themes (free and paid) from outside of the WordPress directory as well.  But be careful about where you find them. Not all themes are created equal!
        
        Here's a [great resource](http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/free-wordpress-themes-ultimate-guide/) with some background about using free vs premium themes as well as where to find them.
        
        For the next exercise, lets install the **Sydney** theme.
        Go to **Appearance > Themes**, select **Add New**.  Do a search for the "Sydney" theme.  Select **Install** and **activate** when it's done.

        Once you've found a theme that you like and only want to make minor colour changes, it's best to use a CSS plugin and update the stylesheet. The stylesheet is the file that controls font colours, size and various style elements.
        You can choose one of these plugins.

        When downloading themes outside of the WordPress directory, it will be provided as a zip file.  Go to **Appearance > Themes > Add new ** (Just like in the previous example) but not this time choose **Upload Theme** and update the zip file (don't unzip it!).

        Any theme you upload, through the WordPress directory or manual upload will be added to your WordPress project files. 
        
        You can find it in **wp-content > themes** in your project folder.  You can also add or delete themes directly in this folder.  **BUT** if you add a theme here, then it needs to be unzipped first.
